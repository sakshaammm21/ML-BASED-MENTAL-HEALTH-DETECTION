# 🧠 Machine Learning Based Mental Health Detection

## 📘 Project Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a person is likely to seek mental health treatment based on responses from a mental health survey. It aims to promote early awareness and encourage mental well-being using data-driven predictions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze mental health survey data
- Build a predictive model to assess treatment needs
- Increase mental health awareness using data science

## 🧪 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression (basic)
- CSV Dataset (survey)

## 📊 Features
- Logistic regression-based prediction
- Accuracy and precision report
- Preprocessing for categorical data
- Easy customization with more features
